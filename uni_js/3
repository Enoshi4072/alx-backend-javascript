//Spies arw a userful wrapper that will execue the wrapped function and log useful informationexample, was it called,with what arguments. Sinon is a library that allows one to create spies
// Lets install Sinon with npm
1. Create a new file named utils.js
2. create a new module named utils
3. Create a property named calculateNumber and paste your previous code in the function
4. EXport the Utils module
// Create a new function named sendPaymentRequestToApi. The function takes two args: total amount and totalShipping
// The function calls the Utils.calculateNumber function with type SUM, totalAmount as b, and displays in the console the message The total is: <result of the sum>
// Create  a new file named 3-payment.test.js and add a new suite named sendPaymentRequestToApi:
// By using sinon.spy make sure the math used for sendPaymentRequestToApi(100, 20) is the same as Utils.calculateNumber('SUM', 100, 20) valudate the usage of the utils function
REQUIREMENTS
- Be able to run the test suite using npm test 3-payment.test.js
- Every test should pass without warning
- Use a spy to cmplete the exercise
TIPS
- Restore a spy after using it in a test
- Spies help if one wants to know what the code is doing not downstream APIs or functions
- Remember
